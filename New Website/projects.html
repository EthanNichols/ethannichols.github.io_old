					<div>September 2017 - Current</div>
					<p>This project was all about messing around and experimenting with procedural generation</p>
					<p>As developement with this project continues, it will evetually become a speedrunning game where the unltimate goal is to defeat the final boss as quick as you can.</p></div>

					<div>July 2017</div>
					<p>This project was for Ludum Dare 39, a 48 hour game jam</p>
					<p>This project was my attempt to create a base for a collectable card game. The main mechanic was that your life is also the energy to cast cards.</p>
					<p>While the gameplay wasn't the best, I understand how to start creating a card game for the future.</p></div>

					<div>April 2017</div>
					<p>This project was for Ludum Dare 38, a 48 hour game jam</p>
					<p>This was a remake of an older project that I created as a demo. I added more content to the game, and made it slightly more appealing.</p>
					<p>This was the first time I created random AI for a game, and is one of the better games I have created from scratch.</p></div>

					<div>August 2016</div>
					<p>This project was for Ludum Dare 36, a 48 hour game jam</p>
					<p>This was the first game I ever completed, and the first game jam I completed</p>
					<p>This is a puzzle game, since I didn't want to explain the rules to the player, so they had to figure out the puzzles themselves.</p></div>

					<div>October 2016</div>
					<p>This project was for the RIT-IGM Imagine Cup game jam, a 36 hour game jam</p>
					<p>This was my second game that I created, and I wanted to make a strategy game.</p>
					<p>I probably overscoped this project, but I finished it, and it worked well. It had local multiplayer, but it could have used some balancing for the game.</p></div>
